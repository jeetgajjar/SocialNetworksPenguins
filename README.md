# Social Networks Penguins
## Motivation
###  Penguins?
The background to the name is essential to understanding the main project.
The team was interested in studying the propagation of memes on social media, namely reddit, in order to analyze patterns in past viral memes and potentially applying historical data to see if there are any trends that may be seen.
With this in mind, we begun to then deconstruct some memes and arbitrarily chose the Socially Awkward Penguin to begin with ([example](http://myfunnymemes.com/socially-awkward-penguin-meme-become-the-socially-awesome-penguin/) here).
For the origins of the meme, see [here](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/socially-awkward-penguin).

#### Deconstruction
We broke down the SAP meme into variations of how we have seen it online:

 - Red background; text on top and bottom, 
 - Red background; text on top , 
 - Red background; text on bottom,
 - Blue background; text on top and bottom, 
 - Blue background; text on top , 
 - Blue background; text on bottom,

Taking this concept of deconstruction to other memes, we quickly realized this is not feasible. However, we had inspiration from the deconstruction of the socially awkward penguin which developed into our problem statement.

### Problem Statement
The goal was to determine pixel to pixel interaction among the top websites and recognizing any patterns that top websites share. 

### Approach
- Get list of websites
--Alexaâ€™s top 1 million sites

- Visit each website and extract/compress pixel color mapping

- Combine all website data into single graph

- Analyze data, find patterns

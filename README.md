Midterm Update
Up until now, the project has been going very well.The projectâ€™s direction has steered minutely from saving images, processing, and exporting to capturing the screenshots of webpages, storing them temporarily, then color processing will begin. This decision arose when we realized crawling the Web and saving all images would be infeasible in regards to space. If the images were to be saved then processed, image quality would diminish in order to decrease the total time taken to compute.


There has been a script created which screenshots the image. This particular script is not complete. There will be additional functionality to save the image in a temp directory and delete once processing has been completed. For the retrieval script, the technologies implemented are Selenium and phantom.js. These files have been shared via GitHub.


For image processing and analysis, the goal is to use OpenCV to break the images into sections/regions and extraction of colors. With the supporting data, we then will move onto Phase 3 of our project; to correlate the data and present.
